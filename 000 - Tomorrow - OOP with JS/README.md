# 000 - Tomorrow OOP with JS

This project works on Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using pure JS language. The main folder is called "Ultimate Final Project" which has a simple CLI mini game displayed using ASCII code.

For gaming it, just use the following command to run the code:


```bash
node Main.js
```

Make sure you are in the respective project folder and have Node.js installed on your computer.

The other folders are mini projects that they were exercises to conclude the final work of the course.
